# CECFST_Fire_Resistance
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a thermal-mechanical model for Concrete-Encased Concrete-Filled Steel Tube (CECFST) columns exposed to fire. The model uses the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to predict the temperature distribution and strength degradation of these columns under fire conditions.
